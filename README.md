York SciFi Book Club website
============================

This is the code behind the [York SciFi Book Club website](http://www.yorkscifibookclub.co.uk).

It is designed to be compiled into a static site with Jekyll.

# Use
* Install Ruby (I like rvm).
* Install ImageMagick (`sudo apt install libmagickwand-dev` on Ubuntu).
* Make sure Bundler is installed: `gem install bundler`.
* Clone the repository to a local folder, and `cd` to it.
* Install Ruby Gems: `bundle install`.
* Build the site: `rake`.
